# Defect-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
I have developed a deep learning algorythm that uses the Tensorflow library to train the data and create a CNN model. By using this trained model, the program will be able to accurately detect defective products and provide the necessary visual representation. Also basic structure that I use can be applied to almost on anything
